# Unsupervised_Data_Clustering
Project implements K-Means, Centroid-Linkage, and K-Medoid clustering techniques to find data clusters then evaluate the optimal algorithm by calculating its Dunn index

Due to never pulling the final version from the college hosted server where the remote repo was based, I have lost the final, complete version of this code, 
however, the program works asside from a core dump after runtime output.
